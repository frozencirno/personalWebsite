                What is the purpose of this website?
            </h1>
            <p>
                I am primarly creating this website as a way of putting my thoughts and interests onto a screen, but I also want to use as a way for others to understand me better.
                As an indivual with autism I have always felt misunderstood by others and alone. But I wish to change that. I also want to use this as a possible way of employers to understand me as well.

            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>I am an 18 old male living with autism, with a passion in programing and language learning. I have experience in C/C++ mainly through my exploration into OpenGL and networking<br>
            However, I also have experience in programming in Python and C#. I was taught Python as my first langauge at my secondary school(high school) where I was taught <br>
            the fundimentals of programming.
            </p>

            <p>As of current, I am learning Japanese in hopes of living in Japan in the future, as I have a keen interest in Japanese media like vocaloids, anime, games, and manga<br>
            I also envy the Japanese way of life, the beautiful landscape and the rich history of the country; which stregnthens my desire to live in Japan.
            </p>

                What is the reason behind the username?<br>
                I really like Touhou and the character Cirno! She is really silly and funny, so addmitly she is my comfort character? If that makes sense

            <h1>More information on the things I like</h1>
            <p>I love vocaloids/vocal synths, it's the only music I listen to nowadays. My favourite vocal synths are Adachi Rei and Kasane Teto. The UTAU of Teto to be excact
                <br> There is just something to the sythetic sound which heals my soul! Some of my favourite songs are Daibousou, Machine Love, Kasane tetoritory, Overdrive, Tetoris and more!
                <br>I am uncertain if this love is born from my autism and a mixture of my personality, reguardless I love these songs and vocal synths, they are just too expressive and fun to listen to
            </p>
            <p>For Games some of my favourite games are that of Noita, Ultrakill, Baba is you, Rimworld, Fear and Hunger 1 and Factorio, If I had to pick one and only one it would have to be Noita.
                I really like the creativity of the game with its sandbox of wands and it's physics engine. Oh yeah I should describe what the game is about.
                The game follows a witch(you) as you go through levels of increasing difficulty. Your power is dirrectly linked with the spells you find and the wands you find.
                The wands act as a vessel for the spells which can be combined to create powerful weapons or tools. This is however dependent on your ability to combine the spells. Also there is perma death. 
                So the game gets easier the more knowlage you aquire.
            </p>

                I mentioned language learning previously, addmitly I only started after completing my A Levels as I now have enough time, but so far it is quite fun. 
                Enguaging with japanese media I can understand some of the words being used and it is so satisfying. It is also quite enjoyable to struggle with sentance structure only to understand it with confidence.
